# Expense Tracker Application

This is a full-stack expense tracker application built with React (frontend) and Node.js with Express and MongoDB (backend). The application allows users to track their expenses, manage their budget, and view detailed statistics.

- **Statistics**: View detailed statistics and progress bars for each expense category.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, React Router, FontAwesome, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bcrypt, JWT
- **Styling**: CSS

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB instance.
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository).

### Installation

### 3. **Set up environment variables**

- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

  ```env
  MONGO_URL=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
  JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
  PORT=5000
  ```
````

- Replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with your actual MongoDB connection string.
- Replace `<your-secret-key>` with a secure random string for JWT signing.

For more details on MongoDB connection strings, refer to the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/).

4. **Start the backend server**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Start the frontend development server**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**:
